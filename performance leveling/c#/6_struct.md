# Struct

Structs are an alternative to class definition/instantiation.  The declaration and usage are essentially identical to class, but the memory allocation is contained in stack memory. Stack memory is essentially more quickly allocated and freed.  Stack memory management is optimized for objects with smaller memory footprints.
