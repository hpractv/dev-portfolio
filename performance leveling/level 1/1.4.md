# Skilled with using your editor(s) of choice (Visual Studio, Sublime, Vim, Emacs, etc)

My current IDEs of choice are Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio Code, UltraEdit (text editor), MS SQL Management Studio, and LINQPad.

## Visual Studio
I've developed projects with every version of Visual Studion since version 6.0.  I've built and debugged projects in VB, ASP, C++, C#, and Python.

## Visual Studio Code
I am currently using this for lighter development tasks.  Particularly for markup or scripting language tasks, like MarkDown, HTML, & JavaScript. 

## UltraEdit
I have been using UltraEdit for the last 11 years.  I have used on many different projects. Particulary when I need robust regular expression support, or large text file parsing.  I've even used it as a Linux terminal and SCP client.

## MS SQL Management Studio
This is the IDE I like to use for data exploration and T-SQL testing.  It has a fair amount of code snippet support, and has improved in intellisense support over the years.

 ## LINQPad
 LINQPad is the main tool I use for C# prototyping and data data development.  Since it is fully .Net & NUGET enabled, it offers a really fast and reliable way of testing different coding concepts and patterns without having to create an entire development project.
 
 I also appreciate the fact that it can handle processes which require large memory space (4 GB+).  This makes it an excellent bridge between compiled programs and quick "scripts".  While inheriting all the benefits of coding in a strongly typed language.
