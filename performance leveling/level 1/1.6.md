# Can effectively use the Visual Studio debugger and browser developer console to investigate issues

## Visual Studio

The first version of Visual Studio I worked with was version 6.0 released in 1998.  I have used it to work on VB, ASP, ASP.Net, C#, C++, and Python.  I have professionally used all since then to build and debug web sites, web services, windows services, windows forms/wpf and console programs.

## Web Browser

I've used VS in combination with various browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge to test and debug web applications.  Primarily to step through JavaScript Library calls, CSS styling, and async web calls.
