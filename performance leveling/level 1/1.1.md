# 1.1 - Must be comfortable learning all types of programming (C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, LESS)

I've had the fortune of working on many different enterprise projects during my career.  They range from n-tiered e-commerce/shopping cart engines to analytics and forecasting models. They've had many different data backing layers from flat delimited files to several different varients of SQL servers to NoSQL solutions like Hadoop and XML data stores.

These developement experiences have given me an opportunity to develop, professionally in these languages:
* C#
* T-SQL/PL-SQL/Teradata SQL
* HTML/XML/XSL
* JavaScript
* VB/VBA
* SAS
* C++
* Objective C

My educational background includes a Master of Science in Computing of Data Analysis and Management.  This experience has given me a lot of opportunites code fairly large projects in these set and analytics focused languages:
* Python
* R/Matlab
* F#
